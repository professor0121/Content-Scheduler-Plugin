# Content-Scheduler-Plugin


This **Content Scheduler Plugin** automates the publishing and unpublishing of posts or pages in WordPress. Here's how it works in simple terms:

---

### **What It Does**
1. **Add a Scheduling Option**  
   - It adds a small box (meta box) to the WordPress editor where you can set:  
     - A **Publish Date**: When the post/page will be automatically published.  
     - An **Unpublish Date**: When the post/page will be automatically moved to "Draft."

2. **Save and Use Scheduling Dates**  
   - When you save a post or page, the plugin stores the dates you set in the database.

3. **Check Dates Automatically**  
   - On every page load, the plugin checks:  
     - If the **Publish Date** has passed, it publishes the post/page.  
     - If the **Unpublish Date** has passed, it unpublishes (drafts) the post/page.

4. **Custom Settings (Optional)**  
   - You can add a settings page in the WordPress admin to customize plugin behavior (e.g., notifications when posts are published/unpublished).

### **How It Helps**
- **Saves Time**: You donâ€™t have to manually publish or unpublish posts at specific times.  
- **Improves Workflow**: Great for scheduling campaigns, announcements, or temporary posts.  
- **Easy to Use**: Everything is integrated into WordPress, so there's no need for external tools.

### **Practical Example**
Imagine youâ€™re running a **holiday sale** on your website:
1. You create a post advertising the sale.
2. In the "Content Scheduler" box:
   - Set the **Publish Date** to December 24th at 8:00 AM.  
   - Set the **Unpublish Date** to December 26th at 11:59 PM.  
3. The plugin:
   - Automatically publishes the post on December 24th at 8:00 AM.  
   - Moves the post to "Draft" after December 26th at 11:59 PM.  

You don't need to remember or stay online to make these changes manually!
